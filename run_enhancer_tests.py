    Recent studies have shown that machine learning algorithms can predict disease onset

    The implementation of AI in healthcare has led to significant cost reductions. 
    Early detection through AI reduces treatment costs by 40% according to a 2023 
    report from the Healthcare Analytics Institute.
    
    In radiology, deep learning models analyze medical images faster than human
