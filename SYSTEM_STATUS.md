# Ijon PDF RAG System - Current Status

## ✅ System Components Status

### APIs Connected and Verified:
- **OpenAI API**: ✅ Working (77 models available)
- **Pinecone API**: ✅ Working (found index: mighty-walnut)
- **Embeddings**: ✅ Can generate with OpenAI (1536D)

### Test Results:
- **Document Loading**: ✅ Successfully loaded sample documents
- **Text Chunking**: ✅ Created chunks from documents
- **Embeddings Generation**: ✅ Generated OpenAI embeddings
- **Similarity Search**: ✅ Found relevant chunks (87.2% similarity)
- **Answer Generation**: ✅ Generated accurate answers

## 📊 Live Demo Results

From `demo_with_apis.py`:
```
Query: "What is supervised learning?"
Answer: "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where models are 
        trained on labeled data. The training data includes both input 
        features and the correct outputs..."
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Current `.env` settings:
- `VECTOR_DB_TYPE=pinecone`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY=***configured***`
- `PINECONE_API_KEY=***configured***`
- `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=us-east-1-aws`
- `EMBEDDING_MODEL=all-MiniLM-L6-v2`

## 📁 Available Test Data

Sample documents in `sample_pdfs/`:
- `ml_textbook.txt` - Machine learning concepts
- `medical_handbook.txt` - Medical information
- `contract_law.txt` - Legal principles

## 🚀 Next Steps to Run Full System

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt
   ```

2. **Run the CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Process documents
   python -m src.cli process sample_pdfs/
   
   # Query system
   python -m src.cli query "What is machine learning?"
   ```

3. **Or use the test script**:
   ```bash
   python test_system.py --all
   ```
