# Task Tracking for Ijon PDF RAG System

## Current Task: Testing System with Sample PDFs
**Date Started**: 2025-07-03
**Description**: Set up and test the complete PDF RAG system using mock data and sample PDFs to verify all components work correctly before using real data.

### Progress:
- [x] Built complete Agentic RAG system with knowledge graph
- [x] Created comprehensive testing and evaluation framework
- [x] Implemented calibration system for parameter optimization
- [x] Generate sample PDFs for testing
- [x] Initialize and test the complete pipeline
- [x] Run evaluation with sample data

### Sub-tasks:
1. **Create Mock PDF Generator** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Built utilities to generate test content
   - Created both simple text and full PDF generators

2. **Generate Sample PDFs** ✅ COMPLETED
   - ML/AI textbook content (ml_textbook.txt)
   - Medical handbook excerpt (medical_handbook.txt)
   - Legal document sample (contract_law.txt)

3. **System Initialization** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Created initialization script to verify dependencies
   - Built check_setup.py for basic verification
   - Set up for local file processing

4. **End-to-End Testing** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Created test_system.py for full pipeline testing
   - Built demo_simple.py for concept demonstration
   - Implemented comprehensive evaluation framework
