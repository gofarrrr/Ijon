Clinical Medicine Handbook

Chapter 5: Diabetes Mellitus

Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by chronic hyperglycemia 
resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The chronic hyperglycemia 
of diabetes is associated with long-term damage to various organs.

5.1 Clinical Presentation

Primary symptoms of diabetes include frequent urination (polyuria), excessive thirst 
(polydipsia), unexplained weight loss, extreme fatigue, blurred vision, and slow wound healing. 
These symptoms result from the body's inability to properly use glucose for energy.

5.2 Diagnostic Criteria

Diagnostic tests for diabetes include:
- Fasting Glucose: Normal <100 mg/dL, Prediabetes 100-125 mg/dL, Diabetes ≥126 mg/dL
- 2-hr OGTT: Normal <140 mg/dL, Prediabetes 140-199 mg/dL, Diabetes ≥200 mg/dL
- HbA1c: Normal <5.7%, Prediabetes 5.7-6.4%, Diabetes ≥6.5%

5.3 Management

Management includes lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise), oral medications (metformin, 
sulfonylureas), and insulin therapy for advanced cases. Regular monitoring of blood glucose 
and HbA1c is essential.

Chapter 7: Hypertension

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition in which the blood 
pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular 
disease, stroke, and kidney disease.

7.1 Classification

Blood pressure categories:
- Normal: <120/80 mmHg
- Elevated: 120-129/<80 mmHg
- Stage 1 Hypertension: 130-139/80-89 mmHg
- Stage 2 Hypertension: ≥140/90 mmHg

7.2 Treatment

Treatment includes lifestyle changes (salt restriction, weight loss, exercise) and medications 
(ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, diuretics, calcium channel blockers).
