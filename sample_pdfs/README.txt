Test Documents Information
Generated: 2025-07-03 18:09:10

These are simplified text files that simulate PDF content for testing the RAG system.
In a production environment, these would be actual PDFs processed by PyMuPDF or pdfplumber.

Files generated:
1. ml_textbook.txt - Machine learning concepts and techniques
2. medical_handbook.txt - Medical conditions and treatments  
3. contract_law.txt - Legal principles and contract formation

The RAG system can process these text files directly for testing purposes.
When actual PDF processing is needed, the system will use the PDF extraction pipeline.
