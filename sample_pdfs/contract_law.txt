Principles of Contract Law

Chapter 3: Contract Formation

A contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties that creates mutual 
obligations enforceable by law. The formation of a valid contract requires several essential 
elements that must all be present.

3.1 Essential Elements

A valid contract requires: 
(1) Offer - a clear proposal to enter into an agreement
(2) Acceptance - unqualified agreement to the offer's terms
(3) Consideration - something of value exchanged between parties
(4) Capacity - legal ability of parties to contract
(5) Legal Purpose - the contract must be for a lawful objective

All elements must be present for enforceability.

3.2 Types of Contracts

Contracts can be classified in several ways: 
- Express vs. Implied
- Bilateral vs. Unilateral
- Valid vs. Void vs. Voidable
- Executed vs. Executory

Understanding these classifications is crucial for determining the rights and obligations of parties.

3.3 Breach of Contract

A breach occurs when one party fails to perform their contractual obligations. Remedies include:
- Damages (compensatory, consequential, punitive)
- Specific performance
- Rescission
- Reformation

Chapter 4: Contract Interpretation

Courts interpret contracts to determine the parties' intent. Principles include:
- Plain meaning rule
- Parol evidence rule
- Contra proferentem
- Course of dealing and usage of trade
