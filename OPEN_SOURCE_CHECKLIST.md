## Architecture Summary

The Ijon system is a PDF extraction and RAG system that:
1. Processes PDFs into semantic chunks
2. Enhances chunks with context for better retrieval
3. Generates embeddings using Google's Gemini text-embedding-004
4. Stores vectors in Neon PostgreSQL with pgvector
5. Provides query interface for semantic search

## Ready for Open Source ✅

The repository has been cleaned and is ready for public release. All sensitive information has been removed, documentation is up to date, and the codebase follows clean architecture principles.
