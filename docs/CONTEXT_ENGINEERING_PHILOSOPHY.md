# Context Engineering Philosophy for Ijon PDF RAG System

## Core Principle: "Context is a System, Not a String"

This database is designed around advanced context engineering principles to enable both fast RAG queries and sophisticated agent-based reasoning.

## Two Pipelines, One Foundation

### 1. General RAG Pipeline (Fast Q&A)
- **Purpose**: Quick information retrieval for chatbots and documentation queries
- **Optimization**: Speed and relevance through pre-computed embeddings
- **Key Tables**: `qa_pairs`, `content_chunks`
- **Usage Pattern**: Query → Similarity Search → Return Answer

### 2. Agent Context Pipeline (Deep Reasoning)
- **Purpose**: Rich context assembly for complex, multi-step reasoning
- **Optimization**: Context completeness and coherence
- **Key Tables**: `agent_memories`, `distilled_knowledge`, `agent_scratchpad`
- **Usage Pattern**: Query → Context Building → Progressive Enhancement → Reasoning

## Context Management Strategies

### 1. WRITE - Persistent Context Storage
```
agent_scratchpad → agent_memories → distilled_knowledge
```
- Temporary thoughts in scratchpad
- Important insights promoted to memories
- Refined knowledge distilled for reuse

### 2. SELECT - Strategic Retrieval
```
relevance_score + importance_score + recency → context
```
- Semantic similarity search
- Importance-based ranking
- Time-decay for relevance

### 3. COMPRESS - Context Optimization
```
full_document → chunks → summaries → key_points
```
- Progressive detail levels
- Information retention scoring
- Token-aware compression

### 4. ISOLATE - Context Boundaries
```
session → state → accessible_context
```
- Session-based isolation
- State-scoped access
- Prevents context pollution

## Database Design Principles

### 1. Progressive Enhancement
Start simple with basic RAG, progressively add agent capabilities:
- Level 1: Keyword search
- Level 2: Semantic similarity
- Level 3: Pre-computed Q&A
- Level 4: Dynamic context assembly
- Level 5: Multi-step reasoning with memory

### 2. No Duplication
- Single source of truth for documents
- Multiple views for different use cases
- Shared embeddings across pipelines

### 3. Usage-Driven Evolution
- Track retrieval counts
- Monitor query patterns
- Learn from successful contexts

### 4. Quality Over Quantity
- Relevance scoring throughout
- Confidence levels on all generated content
- Human verification flags

## Context Quality Guidelines

### Avoid These Problems:

1. **Context Poisoning**
   - Bad data corrupting agent decisions
   - Solution: Quality scores and verification flags

2. **Context Distraction**
   - Irrelevant information reducing focus
   - Solution: Relevance scoring and pruning

3. **Context Confusion**
   - Conflicting information from different sources
   - Solution: Source tracking and confidence levels

4. **Context Clash**
   - Incompatible context elements
   - Solution: Relationship mapping and compatibility checks

## Usage Patterns

### For RAG Queries:
```python
# 1. Generate query embedding
# 2. Search similar chunks/Q&A pairs
# 3. Return top matches
# 4. Track usage for cache optimization
```

### For Agent Contexts:
```python
# 1. Initialize session state
# 2. Build base context from relevant documents
# 3. Add distilled knowledge progressively
# 4. Include relevant memories
# 5. Track context evolution
# 6. Compress when needed
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Content Ingestion
- Always generate embeddings immediately
- Create summaries for documents > 10 pages
- Extract Q&A pairs for frequently accessed content

### 2. Context Assembly
- Start with summaries, expand to chunks only when needed
- Use structured_data JSONB for complex relationships
- Maintain context traces for debugging

### 3. Memory Management
- Promote important scratchpad items to memories
- Apply decay rates to old memories
- Periodically compress related memories

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Use materialized views for common queries
- Batch embedding operations
- Implement caching for frequent patterns

## Metrics to Track

### RAG Pipeline:
- Query response time
- Relevance scores
- Cache hit rates
- User satisfaction (upvotes/downvotes)

### Agent Pipeline:
- Context assembly time
- Token usage per session
- Memory retrieval accuracy
- Task completion rates

## Evolution Path

### Phase 1: Basic RAG (Current)
- Document storage and chunking
- Similarity search
- Simple Q&A retrieval

### Phase 2: Enhanced RAG
- Pre-computed Q&A pairs
- Query pattern learning
- Response caching

### Phase 3: Agent Foundations
- Session management
- Memory systems
- Context compression

### Phase 4: Advanced Agents
- Multi-step reasoning
- Tool integration
- Knowledge graph traversal

### Phase 5: Autonomous Agents
- Self-directed learning
- Context strategy optimization
- Cross-session knowledge transfer

## Database Maintenance

### Daily:
- Clean expired scratchpad entries
- Update usage statistics

### Weekly:
- Recompute frequently accessed embeddings
- Analyze query patterns
- Optimize slow queries

### Monthly:
- Archive old sessions
- Retrain compression models
- Review and update this philosophy

Remember: The goal is not to store everything, but to store the right things in the right way for efficient retrieval and reasoning.
