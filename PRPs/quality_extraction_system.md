name: "Quality Knowledge Extraction System: Progressive Research-Based Approach"
description: |

## Purpose
Build a sophisticated quality knowledge extraction system for PDFs that ensures high-quality data for both RAG pipelines and agent context engineering. Using a progressive, research-based approach inspired by Anthropic's principles: start simple, validate rigorously, add complexity only when proven necessary.

## Core Principles
1. **Research-First**: Treat extraction as a research problem with hypotheses and validation
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Start with baseline, add features only when metrics justify
3. **Quality Gates**: Each stage must prove value before proceeding
4. **Continuous Learning**: System improves based on usage patterns and feedback
5. **Context Engineering**: Leverage our dual-pipeline database architecture

---

## Goal
Create a knowledge extraction system that:
- Achieves 85%+ quality scores on diverse PDF types
- Learns from past extractions to improve future quality
- Provides transparent quality metrics
- Scales complexity based on document needs
- Integrates seamlessly with our Neon database

## Why
- **Current Problem**: Manual extraction (Cognitive Prism) doesn't scale
- **Quality Issues**: No systematic validation of extracted knowledge
- **Agent Needs**: Agents require high-quality, context-aware data
- **Business Value**: Reliable knowledge base enables better decision-making

## What
A progressive system that:
- Extracts knowledge with increasing sophistication
- Validates quality at every stage
- Learns from successes and failures
- Provides clear metrics and decision gates
- Integrates with existing dual-pipeline architecture

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Baseline achieves 70%+ quality on simple documents
- [ ] Each stage shows measurable improvement
- [ ] System handles diverse document types
- [ ] Quality metrics correlate with user satisfaction
- [ ] Computational costs remain manageable
- [ ] Integration with MCP enables agent collaboration

            agent_id=agent_id,
            focus_areas=weak_areas,
            examples=examples,
            exercises=self._generate_exercises(weak_areas),
            success_criteria=self._define_improvement_targets(performance)
        )
        
        # Store in agent's memory

### Stage 8: Orchestrator-Worker System (Week 8) - ONLY IF NEEDED
**Hypothesis**: Multi-agent orchestration handles complex documents 50% better

#### Implementation Blueprint
```python
# extraction/orchestrator.py
class ExtractionOrchestrator:
    """Orchestrates complex multi-agent extraction."""
    
    async def should_use_orchestration(self, document: Document) -> bool:
        """Determine if orchestration is needed."""
        
        complexity_score = await self._assess_complexity(document)
        
        # Only use for truly complex cases
        return (
            complexity_score > 0.8 or
            document.page_count > 100 or
            document.has_multiple_languages or
            document.has_complex_tables_figures
        )
    
    async def orchestrate_extraction(self, document: Document) -> ExtractedKnowledge:
        """Coordinate multiple agents for extraction."""
        
        # Analyze document and create plan
        plan = await self._create_extraction_plan(document)
        
        # Spawn specialized workers
        workers = await self._spawn_workers(plan)
        
        # Coordinate parallel extraction
        results = await self._coordinate_extraction(workers, plan)
        
        # Synthesize results
        synthesis = await self._synthesize_results(results)
        
        return synthesis

class ExtractionWorker:
    """Specialized extraction worker."""
    
    def __init__(self, specialization: str):
        self.specialization = specialization
        self.strategies = self._load_strategies(specialization)
    
    async def extract_section(self, 
                            section: DocumentSection,
                            context: ExtractionContext) -> SectionExtraction:
        """Extract knowledge from assigned section."""
        
        strategy = self._select_strategy(section)
        extraction = await strategy.extract(section, context)
        
        return SectionExtraction(
            section_id=section.id,
            extraction=extraction,
            worker_id=self.id,
            confidence=self._calculate_confidence(extraction)
        )
```

#### Validation Plan
```yaml
Complex Documents:
  - Multi-chapter textbooks
  - Mixed-language documents
  - Technical specs with tables
  - Documents with cross-references

Success Criteria:
  - 50%+ improvement on complex docs
  - Computational overhead acceptable
  - Clear complexity triggers
  - Graceful degradation
```

## Validation Loop

### Per-Stage Validation
```python
# validation/stage_validator.py
class StageValidator:
    """Validates each stage meets success criteria."""
    
    async def validate_stage(self, stage: int) -> ValidationReport:
        # Run stage-specific tests
        test_results = await self._run_stage_tests(stage)
        
        # Compare against baseline
        improvement = await self._measure_improvement(stage)
        
        # Check decision gates
        gates_passed = await self._check_gates(stage)
        
        return ValidationReport(
            stage=stage,
            test_results=test_results,
            improvement_metrics=improvement,
            gates_passed=gates_passed,
            recommendation=self._recommend_next_action(gates_passed)
        )
```

### Continuous Monitoring
```yaml
Metrics Dashboard:
  - Real-time quality scores
  - Extraction success rates
  - User satisfaction metrics
  - Computational costs
  - Error categorization

A/B Testing:
  - Compare approaches systematically
  - Statistical significance testing
  - Rollback capability

Human Validation:
  - Weekly quality audits
  - Expert review for domains
  - User feedback integration
```

## Integration Points

### Database Integration
```sql
-- Store extraction metadata
INSERT INTO content_chunks (
    document_id,
    content,
    chunk_metadata, -- extraction approach, quality scores
    embedding
) VALUES (...);

-- Track quality evolution
INSERT INTO agent_memories (
    agent_id,
    memory_type,
    content, -- successful patterns
    importance_score -- based on quality
) VALUES (...);

-- Pre-compute high-quality Q&A
INSERT INTO qa_pairs (
    question,
    answer,
    answer_confidence,
    human_verified
) VALUES (...);
```

### MCP Integration
```yaml
Endpoints:
  - /extraction/submit - Submit document for extraction
  - /extraction/status - Check extraction progress
  - /extraction/quality - Get quality metrics
  - /extraction/guidelines - Get current best practices
```

## Decision Framework

### When to Progress to Next Stage
```python
def should_progress(current_stage: int, metrics: StageMetrics) -> bool:
    """Decide if we should move to next stage."""
    
    # Must meet success criteria
    if not metrics.success_criteria_met:
        return False
    
    # Improvement must justify complexity
    if metrics.improvement < MINIMUM_IMPROVEMENT[current_stage]:
        return False
    
    # Cost must be acceptable
    if metrics.computational_cost > MAX_COST_MULTIPLIER[current_stage]:
        return False
    
    # User satisfaction must improve or maintain
    if metrics.user_satisfaction < metrics.baseline_satisfaction:
        return False
    
    return True
```

### When to Stop Adding Complexity
- Stage improvements < 10%
- Computational costs > 5x baseline
- User satisfaction plateaus
- Error rates increase

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Over-engineering**: Strict decision gates prevent unnecessary complexity
- **Quality degradation**: Continuous monitoring with rollback capability
- **Performance issues**: Cost tracking and limits at each stage
- **Integration failures**: Modular design allows partial deployment

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Deployment**: Deploy stages independently
2. **Feature Flags**: Toggle features for testing
3. **Rollback Plan**: Each stage can run independently
4. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and alerts

## Success Metrics

### Overall System Success
- 85%+ quality scores on diverse documents
- 50%+ improvement over baseline
- <5x computational cost increase
- 90%+ user satisfaction
- Clear ROI demonstration

### Per-Stage Success
See individual stage success criteria above

## Timeline

### 8-Week Progressive Implementation
- Week 1: Baseline system + validation
- Week 2: Document-aware extraction
- Week 3: Quality scoring framework
- Week 4: Collaborative validation
- Week 5: Intelligent questions
- Week 6: Memory integration
- Week 7: MCP interface
- Week 8: Orchestration (if needed)

### Go/No-Go Decision Points
- After each weekly stage
- Based on metrics and criteria
- Clear documentation of decisions

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Adding features without proving value
- ❌ Skipping validation to save time
- ❌ Ignoring computational costs
- ❌ Over-optimizing for edge cases
- ❌ Building complex orchestration prematurely
- ❌ Neglecting user feedback

## Confidence Score: 9/10

High confidence due to:
- Progressive approach reduces risk
- Clear validation at each stage
- Existing infrastructure ready
- Strong theoretical foundation
- Flexibility to stop at any stage

Minor uncertainty:
- Exact improvement percentages
- Optimal stage ordering (can adjust based on findings)
